## Note for grader

I mistyped my commit for step 3, even though i did it i accidentally titled it (step 2 complete) so there is two step two completions but the rest of the commit message will clarify that they are not actually the same commits. tried to adjust it using git hub commands but was not able to. All other commits have the correct step number when the step was completed.
